Command-Line Tarot Deck
and Interactive Tarot Deck
by Dave Wollyung
--------------------------

Usage:
java Tarot [n] - Draws the configured number of Tarot cards, or n cards if specified
java TCL - Launches the interactive Tarot deck; a list of commands will be printed

Comments
--------
The randomization function is no different than any other - it relies on system time.
This does not make it ineffective for any degree of psychic reading, it simply transfers
all of the energy involved into the timing of entering the command. Music may help.

The project was inspired by chaos magicians and their need to incorporate input into the
randomization seed, which is done via the "ask" command in the TCL program.

There was also an IRC robot that dealt Tarot cards but would often repeat them, and that
annoyed me. Both programs maintain the deck.

Also, I disagree with The Pictorial Key to the Tarot's swapping of Strength and Justice
based on the way I learned Tarot (Strength turns the Wheel of Fortune and so on), but
since this order is hidden in the code I don't think it matters.
